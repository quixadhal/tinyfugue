      _T_i_n_y_F_u_g_u_e (also known as "Fugue" or "TF") is a line-based client
      designed for connecting to MUD servers (note: LP, DIKU, and other
      servers which use prompts require "/lp on"; see /help prompts).

      Most of the _T_F documentation is in the help file, which may be read
      online with the "/help" command.  This manual page may be obsolete in
      certain areas; however, the helpfile will always be up to date.

      _T_i_n_y_F_u_g_u_e is larger than most MUD clients, but has many more features
      and is much more flexible.  The goal is to provide the most
      functionality in a client that still maintains the user-friendliness
      of _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k.  Clients with extension languages such as _T_c_l_t_t or
      _V_a_p_o_r_T_a_l_k can do a little more in certain areas, but are considerably
      harder to use and learn.  _T_F provides most of these abilities in such
      a manner that learning to use any one function is relatively easy.

      Because I am continually adding new features and changing the code, _T_F
      sometimes becomes less stable in a new release.  Versions labled
      "alpha" are generally not as well tested as "beta" versions, so they
      have the potential for more bugs.  For this reason, I leave some older
      versions at the ftp site where I distribute _T_F (ftp.tcp.com), which do
      not have all the current features but may have fewer bugs than the
      most recent release.

      With no arguments, _T_F will try to connect to the first world defined
      in the configuration file(s).

      With a wwwwoooorrrrlllldddd argument, _T_F will try to connect to wwwwoooorrrrlllldddd, as defined in
      the configuration file.  If wwwwoooorrrrlllldddd is omitted, it will try to connect
      to the first world defined in your configuration files.

      _T_F will attempt to read two files when starting.  The first is a
      public configuration file "stdlib.tf", located in TFLIBDIR.  TFLIBDIR
      is defined when _T_F is installed, and is often /usr/local/lib/tf.lib,
      or under the home directory of the installer.  This library contains
      many macros and definitions essential to the correct operation of _T_F.

      Next, _T_F will attempt to read your personal configuration file,
      $HOME/.tfrc, in which you can put any _T_F commands you want executed
      automatically at startup.  Two of the most useful commands to use in a
      _T_F configuration file are /addworld and /load.

      For backward compatability, _T_F will also try to read the _T_i_n_y_T_a_l_k
      configuration file.  Its name defautls to $HOME/.tinytalk, or can be
      defined by the TINYTALK environment variable.  This file may start
      with a list of worlds that will be defined as if with /addworld.

      Anton Rang (Tarrant) in February of 1990 released _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k, the first
      Tinyclient with any great number of features, including hiliting and
      suppression of text, simple triggers, and separating input and output
      on the screen.  Leo Plotkin (Grod) made rather extensive modifications
      to _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k to produce _T_i_n_y_w_a_r, which was plagued with some serious
      bugs and was never officially released (the phrase "Tinywar doesn't
      exist" is often quoted), and is now an unsupported client.  _T_F began
      when Greg Hudson (Explorer_Bob) merged many of the new features of
      _T_i_n_y_w_a_r back into _T_i_n_y_T_a_l_k, and added many new features of his own,
      most notably the split screen.  Some of the code in Greg's releases
      was contributed by Leo Plotkin.  After Greg moved on to _V_a_p_o_r_T_a_l_k, Ken
      Keys (Hawkeye) took over design and maintenance of _T_F in July 1991,
      and continues to make improvements in features and performance.

      The code size of _T_F has surpassed 300K (unstripped), and is
      signifigantly larger than _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k.  It is, in fact, more than three

      has 66 builtin commands and 57 library commands, each documented in
      the helpfile.

      It has been stated that _T_F is the most-used client in MUDdom at the
      current time.  I haven't taken a poll, but I wouldn't be surprised.

      _T_F has significantly changed the tinyclient world.  It has a number of
      merits and a number of flaws, and has frequently been criticized
      (mostly out of boredom; nobody takes this business too seriously) as
      having too many features and being too damn big.

           "Tinywar doesn't exist; TinyFugue merely shouldn't." -- Coined by
      Woodlock, I believe.

           "TinyFugue is a work of art." -- Binder, obviously after having
      too much to drink.

           "TinyFugue is the biggest hack since the platform it was built
      on." -- Explorer_Bob, in one of his lucid moments.

      The New York Times, the Christian Science Monitor and the Washington
      Post all refused to comment.

      Backslashes in macros are interpreted slightly differently than in
      previous versions.  Turning on the "backslash" flag will enable the
      old behavior.

      VERSION 2.1

      The CONNECT hook is now called before the LOGIN hook.  In 2.0, CONNECT
      was called after autologin.

      VERSION 2.0

      In versions prior to 2.0, <space> was used to scroll the pager; 2.0
      uses <tab> as the default, to allow the pager to be nonblocking.

      _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k style name gags and hilites are no longer supported.  You
      must use the '*' wildcard explicitly, as in '/hilite hawkeye*'.

      _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k style page and whisper hilites are no longer supported.
      However, /hilite_page and /hilite_whisper macros are provided in the
      default macro library.

      The .tinytalk file may not be supported in the future; use .tfrc
      instead.

      The '-' command line option in versions prior to 2.0 is no longer
      supported, and has been replaced with '-l'.
