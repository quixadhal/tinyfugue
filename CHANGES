Notation for relases pre-1.4.0 beta is not particularly accurate, and
sometimes changed code was released without updating version numbers.
I don't do this any more.
Only the most recent version will have detailed changes described.

3.3 beta 4
----------
Minor fix in idea of current world after /fg in fall-thru triggers/hooks.
Minor fix for recall messages while logging.
Fix for empty /cat text.
Internal changes.

Fixed potentially fatal bug in oneshots.

3.3 beta 2 (3/9/94)
----------
Fixed "OOPS" problem with simulated scrolling on deficient terminals (33a?).
Fixed error on old systems without FD_SET() and friends, e.g. AIX (33a?).

3.3 beta 1 (3/3/94)
----------
Changes since 3.2 beta 4:
Partial hilites enhanced to work on multiple matches on the same line.
Regexp subexpressions can now be accessed as Pn variables as well as %Pn subs.
"/recall /n pattern" recalls the last <n> lines that match <pattern>,
  instead of searching for <pattern> in the last <n> lines.
Added /substitute, to modify triggering text in place.
Added mod() function.

The differences section only applies to things that need to be changed
or are not implemented in TinyFugue.  Tf offers a lot more functionality
in many areas than the clients below, of course.

-------------
Differences from TinyTalk (Tarrant's client)
-------------
Compatibility is almost complete.  All .tinytalk files should work
with Fugue.  The /tinytalk flag (defaults to on) makes the necessary
changes to convert between tinytalk command formats to tinyfugue
command formats.

-------------
Differences from TinyWar (Grod's client)
-------------
Use /sub on to substitute %; and %\ for newlines in regular text
%n works only in macros and triggers, and in /sub full mode
/crypt and /random removed
"%2*" argument sub should be replaced by "%-1"
