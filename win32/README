                           TinyFugue for Win32


At this time, TF for win32 is available only in source form.  To compile
it, you will need the Cygwin Development Kit (cdk.exe), available at
http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/.  Once you have the CDK installed,
follow the instructions for compiling TF under UNIX.

The CDK is rather large (over 13M), and not for the novice user.  If you
have trouble with it, DON'T ASK ME.  I plan to make a binary release of TF
(which will require only the 500K cygwin.dll) when I get the time, so wait
for that if you can't deal with the CDK.

There are several known problems with the win32 version of tf, mostly due
to shortcomings of cygwin:
 * Scrolling in visual mode is jumpy.
 * /quote ! (and code that calls it, like /sys) is not supported.
 * Compressed files are not supported.
 * Nonblocking hostname resolution (%gethostbyname) is not supported.
