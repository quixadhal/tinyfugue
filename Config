#  TinyFugue configuration file
# 
###########################################################################
# 
#  The autoconfig script can usually figure out everything it needs to know
#  about your system, so you probably won't need to edit this file unless
#  you want to change some defaults or enable some optional features.
#  See the README file if you have problems or want to make any changes.
#
#  Just type "make" to install everything.
#
#  If you edit anything, make sure everything on the right side of a
#  assignment is enclosed in quotes.  In the instructions, "uncomment"
#  means remove the "#" character from the beginning of the line.
#

### File Locations.
# Default locations for files are /usr/local/{bin,lib} if writable,
#   or $HOME/{bin,lib} if they exist, or $HOME.  So you probably don't
#   need to edit this.  To change any file location, uncomment and edit
#   the appropriate line below.
# Do NOT under any circumstances attempt to install files in the build
#   tree (i.e., the directory unpacked from the archive).
# If SYMLINK is defined, it will be used as the name of a symbolic link
#   to the executable file.
# For public installation, I recommend uncommenting the names below.
#   TFVER is pre-defined, and contains an abbreviated version number.
#   Using numbered filenames makes it easier to install a new version
#   even if an old version is currently in use.  You can remove
#   the old version manually when it is no longer in use.

# EXE="/usr/local/bin/tf.${TFVER}"
# LIBDIR="/usr/local/lib/tf.${TFVER}.lib"
# SYMLINK="/usr/local/bin/tf"


### Manual Page.
# Man page will not be installed by default.  To have it installed,
# uncomment and edit the lines below.  Set MANTYPE=nroff if your man
# uses nroff format; set MANTYPE=cat if your man uses pre-formatted
# vt100 "catman" pages.  Default is "cat".

# MANTYPE="nroff"
# MANPAGE="/usr/local/man/man1/tf.1"


### Flags.
# This is the place to add flags as instructed by the README file.

FLAGS=''


### Unwanted Features.
# TF can be made slightly smaller at the expense of losing functionality.
# Uncomment one or more of the lines below to disable a feature.
# See also "Terminal Handling".

# FLAGS="$FLAGS -DNO_HISTORY"; # Disable /recall, /log, ^P, etc.
# FLAGS="$FLAGS -DNO_PROCESS"; # Disable /repeat and /quote.
# FLAGS="$FLAGS -DNO_NETDB"  ; # Disable hostname resolving and service names.


### Terminal Driver.
# The autoconfig script can usually figure this out by itself.  You only need to
# uncomment one of these lines if autoconfig figures incorrectly.

# TTYDRIVER='USE_TERMIOS'
# TTYDRIVER='USE_TERMIO'
# TTYDRIVER='USE_SGTTY'


### Terminal Handling.
# If you do not uncomment one of the TERMINAL lines below, autoconfig will
# use TERMCAP if it can, HARDCODE if not.  With HARDCODE, TF will work
# only on a vt100 or compatible terminal (or, you can edit the control
# sequences at the top of output.c to make it work on another type of
# terminal).  Some space can be saved (at the expense of flexibility)
# by not using termcap.

# TERMINAL='TERMCAP'
# TERMINAL='HARDCODE'
# TERMINAL='NO_SCREEN'


### Mail Directory.
# If the MAIL environment variable is not set at runtime, TF will assume
# mail is kept in a central spool directory.  Normally, the autoconfig script
# can find the mail directory by itself; you only need to set MAILDIR below
# if your system keeps mail in an unusual place.  If it keeps incoming mail
# in the recipient's home, see the example in tf.lib/local.tf.sample.

# MAILDIR='/weird/mail/directory'


### Compiler.
# If you do not specify CC here, autoconfig will use "gcc" if available,
# otherwise "cc".  If for some strange reason gcc is installed on your
# system but doesn't work, use "cc" (and complain to your sysadmin).
# If you do not specify CCFLAGS here, autoconfig will use "-O".

# CC="cc"
# CCFLAGS="-g"


### Stripping.
# Autoconfig will use "strip" on the tf binary unless you tell it otherwise.
# Set STRIP='' to disable stripping.

# STRIP=''


### C Library.
# Uncomment and edit the next line if autoconfig can't find your C library.

# LIBC='/weird/libc.a'


### Other Compiler Libraries.
# This is the place to add extra libraries as described in README
# if your linker can't resolve an external reference.

LIBS=''


### Make Program.

MAKE='make'

if [ -z "$TFVERSION" ]; then
    echo "Use 'make' to install TinyFugue."
