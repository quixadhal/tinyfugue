<h1>problems</h1>

<p>
  If you have an old version of TF, chances are your bug has already been
  fixed.  The latest version of TF should be available for anonymous ftp from
  tf.tcp.com in pub/tinyfugue.

<p>
  Also see
  <a href="http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/">http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/</a>
  for the latest info on TF.  See "/help mailing list" for information
  on how to subscribe to the tinyfugue mailing list.

<p>
  Send general bug reports, questions, etc, to hawkeye@tcp.com.  For
  problems specific to the OS/2 version, contact Andreas Sahlbach at
  asa@stardiv.de.  When reporting a problem or bug, please provide this
  information:

<ul>
<li>The full version number of TF (type
    "<a href="../commands/version.html">/version</a>" in tf).
    Please give the <em>full</em> number, don't just say something like
    "beta 4" or "the latest version".
<li>The operating system name and version.  (On unix systems, type
    "<code>uname -a</code>" in the shell to get the exact version information.)
<li>If tf won't install, send the Build.log file (UNIX only) if there is one,
    or send a log of the installation errors (don't leave out parts just
    because you don't know what they mean or think they're irrelevant).
<li>If you have a bug or core, give me ALL messages from tf, not just the
    last line.  Also tell me what you did or what happened before the problem,
    and whether the problem is repeatable.
<li>If you have a core, do NOT send the core file.  But if you know how,
    and tf was compiled with debugging option (usually '-g'), a stack
    trace would be useful (use the 'where' command in gdb or dbx).  If you
    don't know how, at least provide the other information described above.
</ul>

<p>
<a name=""></a> The following bugs are known.  Don't bother reporting them.
<ul>

<li>
  The <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#lp">%{lp}</a> and
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#emulation">%{emulation}</a>
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variables</a> should work on a
  per-<a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>
  basis (This is partially overcome with WORLD
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hooks</a>).

<li>
  If a shell quote (<a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote</a> !) reads a
  partial line from the child process, tf will hang until the line is
  completed.

<li>
  <a href="../commands/recall.html">/recall</a> by timestamp doesn't work
  when switching to/from daylight savings time (but
  <a href="../commands/recall.html">/recall</a> by age always works).

</ul>
