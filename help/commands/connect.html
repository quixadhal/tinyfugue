<h1>/connect</h1>

<p>
  Usage:

<p>
  <a href="../commands/connect.html">/CONNECT</a> [-lq] [<i>world</i>]<br>
  <a href="../commands/connect.html">/CONNECT</a> <i>host</i> <i>port</i><br>
<hr>

<p>
  Attempts to open a <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> connected to
  <i>world</i>.  <i>World</i> must be defined by the
  <a href="../commands/addworld.html">/addworld</a> command and not already
  connected.  If <i>world</i> is omitted, the first defined world will be
  used.
  If <i>world</i> does not have a host and port,
  <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> will
  create a "connectionless" <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>.
  In the form
  "<a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> <i>host</i>
  <i>port</i>", it will define a temporary world named
  "<code>(unnamed<i>N</i>)</code>" with the given address, and try
  to connect to it.  <i>Host</i> may be an internet hostname, an IPv4
  address, or (if your platform supports it) an IPv6 address.
  A temporary world will be undefined when it is no longer in use.

<p>
  <a href="../topics/options.html">Options:</a>
  <dl compact>
  <dt>-l
          <dd>No <a href="../topics/login.html">automatic login</a>
          (i.e., don't call the <a href="../topics/login.html">LOGIN</a>
          <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>).
  <dt>-q
          <dd>Quiet login (overrides
          <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#quiet">%{quiet}</a>
          flag).
  <dt>-x
          <dd>Connect using SSL (not necessary if
          <a href="../topics/worlds.html">world</a> was defined with the
	  "x" flag).
  </dl>
  When a new <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> is created and
  (unless it is connectionless) its network connection is successfully made,
  these events occur:
<ul>
  <li>If the <a href="../topics/worlds.html">world</a> was defined with an
    <i>mfile</i>, that file will be loaded
    (and the LOAD <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> will be called);
  <li>The CONNECT <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> is called
    (unless the socket is connectionless).  The
    default CONNECT <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> calls
    <a href="../commands/fg.html">/fg</a> to bring the new
    <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> into the
    <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a>.
  <li>If <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#login">%{login}</a> is on,
    and a character and password is defined for the
    <a href="../topics/worlds.html">world</a>, the LOGIN
    <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> is called
    (unless the socket is connectionless).
    The default LOGIN
    <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hooks</a> sends the character name and
    password in a format corresponding to the world type.  To automatically
    login to a world that expects a different login format, define your own
    LOGIN <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>.
</ul>

<p>
  When a hostname is given, TF must resolve it to an IP address.  If
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#gethostbyname">%{gethostbyname}</a>
  is "nonblocking" (the default), and this process takes too long,
  TF will print "Hostname resolution for <i>world</i> in progress" (the PENDING
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>) and continue to work in the
  background, leaving you free to do other things.  If the resolution
  succeeds, TF will try to connect; if it fails, you will be notified.

<p>
  On most platforms, if 
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#connect">%{connect}</a> is
  "nonblocking" (the default) and the connection takes too long,
  TF will print "Connection to <i>world</i> in progress" (the PENDING
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>) and continue to try to connect in
  the background, leaving you free to do other things.  If the connection
  eventually succeeds, you will be switched to that
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> (but see note below); if it
  fails, you will be notified.

<p>
  Even if 
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#gethostbyname">%{gethostbyname}</a>
  and/or <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#connect">%{connect}</a> are
  "blocking", they can be interrupted with the SIGINT
  <a href="../topics/signals.html">signal</a> (^C).

<p>
  When a pending <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> succeeds,
  the <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foregrounding</a> is done by
  a CONNECT <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>
  defined by the standard library.
  If you don't want to switch automatically, you can either delete the default
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>
  (<code><a href="../commands/undef.html">/undef</a>
  ~connect_switch_hook</code>)
  or define your own
  (with a <a href="../topics/priority.html">priority</a> higher than 0).
  If you define your own but you still want
  the switch to occur, you must either make it a
  <a href="../topics/priority.html">fall-thru</a>,
  or explicitly call
  "<code><a href="../commands/fg.html">/fg</a>
  <a href="../topics/substitution.html#%n">%1</a></code>" from your
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>.

<p>
  If you have trouble connecting (especially if you use SOCKS),
  try setting
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#connect">connect</a>=blocking.

<p>
  If your host has multiple network interfaces, the OS will choose one of
  them for the client end of the connection according to its own rules.
  To override the system's choice, set the
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#tfhost">tfhost</a> variable
  or define the <a href="../topics/worlds.html">world</a> with a
  <i>srchost</i> parameter to
  <a href="../commands/addworld.html">addworld</a>.

<p>
  <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> returns 0 on error or
  failure, 1 on success, or 2 if the connection is pending.
