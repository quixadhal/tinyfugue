TinyFugue versions 1.5.3 and earlier were written by Greg Hudson.

TinyFugue was intially derived from a client written by Anton Rang and
modified by Leo Plotkin.

Thanks to:

Russ Smith (Random), for writing the first tinyclient.

Anton Rang (Tarrant), for writing the client this whole thing was based
on, and for finding some minor bugs in earlier versions.

Greg Hudson (Explorer_Bob), for writing the early versions of TF, without
which I would have never gotten into this mess.

Leo Plotkin (Grod), for helping Greg and for writing a beautiful (for
Grodcode), albeit case-sensitive, match routine.

Bruce Sterling Woodcock (Bruce), David Moore (OliverJones), Ben Jackson
(Ben), the mudders of glia.biostr.washington.edu, and everyone else who
tested, found bugs, or came up with suggestions.
